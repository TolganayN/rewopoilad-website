            <h1>How does plastic affect your health?</h1>
            <p>
                It's important to understand that
plastic was seen by many as a
revolutionary product, and it can
save lives and optimize processes
in settings like hospitals. Everything
from your raincoat to your car
seatbelt is made from plastic,
making our lives easier and safer.
However, the rate at which plastic is
manufactured and disposed of
needs to be more sustainable. The
impact of all the world's existing
plastic will have long-lasting effects
on human health for centuries.
            </p>
            <h1>
                1.Production of plastic is linked to respiratory problems
            </h1>
            <p>The manufacturing and improper disposal of plastic cause respiratory problems for millions of people around the world
                Plastic manufacturing requires the extraction of raw materials, like crude oil or natural gasses, and energy-intensive processes to turn them into plastic. According to the OECD, 1.8 billion tonnes of carbon emissions were attributed to plastic globally in 2019, equivalent to 3.7% of the world’s emissions.
                On top of that, end-of-life plastic practices add to air pollution that can harm human health.
                Burning plastic is still a common way to dispose of plastic in most countries, and releases an unprecedented amount of harmful chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), into the air. 
                Not only is this harmful when inhaled by humans, but it also contributes to climate change. The health issues are even more severe for those in plastic manufacturing and disposal, as they often inhale more plastic particles through their work.</p>
        <h1>2.Microplastics cause damage to human cells</h1>
        <p>Scientists have found that microplastics can damage and kill human cells.
            In 2021, a study examined human cells exposed to contaminated drinking water, seafood, and table salt. The results overwhelmingly showed that cells exposed to microplastics suffered from cytotoxicity (death of the cell), allergic reactions, and tissue damage. 
            The scientists also added that more research was needed as it’s unclear how long microplastics remain in the human body and what that impact has. 
            But why is cell damage bad? Cells have a variety of jobs to do, but they mainly ensure our body is functioning correctly. Changes can weaken a human’s immune system and lead to cell mutations linked to certain cancers.</p>
           <h1>3.Plastic exposure may impact future generations before they’re born</h1>
           <p>While the 2021 study couldn’t conclude how cell damage from plastic impacts the human body, other studies have determined that microplastics exist in many body parts — including the placenta, which provides nutrients to growing babies. 
            Another 2021 paper revealed several microplastic particles on the fetal side of the placenta, as well as the mother’s side. The study revealed that the plastic particles they detected came from artificial coatings, paints, adhesives, and cosmetics. 
            However, more research is needed to understand whether the microplastics are passed from the mother onto the baby via the placenta.
            Reports also claimed that babies have 15 times more microplastics in their bodies than adults due to chewing on dummies and being in closer contact with plastic particles. Since plastic can damage human cells, scientists speculate that exposure at such an early developmental age may lead to later health issues.</p>
